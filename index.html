            <p>Hi My name is Katie Birge. I was borne and raised in Austin TX. My parents names are George and Margarida Birge. I have one brother also named George who is 5 years older than me. He lives in Nashvile and is a country music artist. Some of my favorite things to do are walking my Australian Shepherd named Mandy and finding fun places to hike. I also really enjoy cooking for my friends and family.</p>
